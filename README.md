# Python-Side-Projects
So, there's this tech mentorship program in my school for different tracks like Frontend Dev., Backend Dev., UI/UX, AI/ML and the likes.
I signed up for the AI/ML track.
We have tasks to turn in at the end of particular stages in our learning paths.
This repository represents the end of the first stage in mine.
